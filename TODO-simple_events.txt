things to discuss

date issue:  looks like we basically need the smart date.  we can't use the range date without an end date or a stupid patch.
    we can't pull 1 date feed itme into 2 fields without a module or custom code.  
    we can't seperate the date and time (with a simple date/ date range field) without a lot of work. 

location: we can't have both a map and a maps link

we can't really pull in multiple department tags without a lot of work, or another module, etc. 

This was supposed to be a 'simple' event.  Once we make what we have work into Chris's design we should move on.  
    I've learned some stuff we can use in the more sophisticated event type.


after discussion document decisions, considerations and drawbacks in confluence.
