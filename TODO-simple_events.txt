things to discuss


we can't really pull in multiple department tags without a lot of work, or another module, etc. 


after discussion document decisions, considerations and drawbacks in confluence. 

date issue:  looks like we basically need the smart date.  we can't use the range date without an end date or a stupid patch.
    we can't pull 1 date feed itme into 2 fields without a module or custom code.  
    we can't seperate the date and time (with a simple date/ date range field) without a lot of work. 


One solution for the date, is if smart date doesn't do exactly what we want. use a hook in the event module to make the end date the same as the start date, if there isn't an end date. 
Then in twig use some simple logic with the dates to only display the time in a different field if the date is the same 


To Do on Monday:

play with smart date, to see if it has the functionality we need, e.g. no end date required, feed fills in the start date.  Start date shows only, then with end date and the time split up 
if not, then proceed with the solution above.  so
use a hook in the module that has the events to fill in the end date with the same date as the smart date if there is no end date. 
then using the theme/twig it would split up the time to match chris's design.
